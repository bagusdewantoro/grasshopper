Some experiments for daily architectural design method problem using algorithm approach.
The case is how to make a panel on a curve surface with adjustable height and panel weight.
There are 3 basic panel moduls.
When we draw a curve across the surface, the surface will choose each basic panel based on its distance to the curve.
